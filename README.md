# Ric's Movie Catalog Project Documentation

- **Name:** Ric Ryan Nolasco
- **Block/Course:** BSIT3 - B2

## WHAT:

This project was assigned by our professor to demonstrate our understanding of web development by creating a JavaScript program that interfaces with TheMovieDB REST API. The program is designed to retrieve essential movie data, presenting it through an HTML structure with CSS styling. Additionally, it includes features allowing users to navigate through movie entries and features that asesses the ratings via coloration.

## WHY:

The primary aim of this project is to gauge our proficiency in utilizing REST APIs, fetching data, and manipulating it for display within a web application.

## HOW

### Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

For the frontend, HTML and CSS were employed. JavaScript's asynchronous functions (`async` and `await`) were utilized for data fetching. These functions gather data encapsulated as promises, expecting an entry to fetch the promised data. Moreover, DOM manipulation was employed to dynamically adjust the HTML structure based on the retrieved movie data from the API.

## Notes

This project is an academic exercise. The tools utilized include:

- VSCODE
- Git Version Control
- TheMovieDB API
